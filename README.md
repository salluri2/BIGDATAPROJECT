# Communication Plan:
We are communicating with the teammates through email, slack and decided to connect every weekend through zoom calls.

# Business Problem or Opportunity:
The dataset under consideration here is from the CDC's yearly poll of individuals regarding their health status. The dataset originated from the CDC and is a significant component of the Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which conducts annual telephone surveys to collect information on Americans' health conditions. Heart disease, one of the major causes of death for people of most races in the US, is caused by high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking, according to the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). Other significant indicators are the presence of diabetes, obesity (high BMI), a lack of physical activity, and excessive alcohol consumption. Data from 2020 is included in the most recent dataset (as of February 15, 2022). The dataset we selected will undergo data pre-processing so that we can apply a spectrum of machine learning models to derive and identify "patterns" from the data that can predict a patient's condition because identifying and preventing the factors that have the greatest impact on heart disease is very important in healthcare.

# Research Objectives:
We pre-process the dataset and use the data to make predictions and derive insights. Using multiple factors like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, and BMI we can train a machine learning model on this dataset to predict a person's risk of developing heart disease considering the various factors present in the dataset.
